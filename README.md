# RipePotatoes

Ripe Potatoes is my attempt at stepping into a project with a much larger-scale backend. The application is meant to be a movie review blog, taking advantage of the well-structured The Movie Database API. I took on this project to better understand how a more complex relational database should be structured, and how a backend API should interact with that database.
